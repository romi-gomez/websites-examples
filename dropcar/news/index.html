                  <p>NEW YORK, Oct. 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DropCar, Inc. (“DropCar”), a software and logistics
                    provider of cloud- and app-based vehicle support and concierge services for both the automotive
                    industry and consumers, today announced a new partnership with Manhattan Motorcars, Inc., a dealer
                    of Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti vehicles. DropCar will provide its Vehicle Assistance
                    & Logistics technology platform (“VAL”) for Manhattan Motorcars’ maintenance and sales teams,
                    allowing them to provide an entirely new level of service to their customers.<br><br>

                    Manhattan Motorcars now joins Jaguar and Land Rover of Manhattan, Mercedes Benz of Manhattan and
                    Lexus of Manhattan, as well as other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and dealerships
                    operating throughout the tristate area that utilize DropCar to support their urban mobility.<br><br>

                    DropCar’s VAL platform coordinates the movements and schedules of professional valets who transport
                    vehicles to and from dealerships to customer locations, removing the need for a customer to drive
                    their vehicle in for service. Dealerships access the VAL platform via any browser where they can
                    schedule, track in real time and report on vehicle movements, repair status and customer feedback.
                    This level of convenience enables dealers to retain valuable post-sale service contracts and revenue
                    from their customers.<br><br>

                    “Our platform enables dealerships to modernize their customer experience by removing the time and
                    hassle associated with bringing a car in for scheduled maintenance or repairs as well as benefiting
                    from greater transparency into their daily operations,” said Spencer Richardson, co-founder and CEO
                    of DropCar. “This model fits in well with the emerging trends of automobile ownership as a service,
                    and we believe enables today’s dealerships to build longer-term relationships with their
                    customers.”<br><br>

                    DropCar’s VAL platform helps dealerships address challenges stemming from several major societal
                    shifts, such as:<br><br>

                    Today’s urban professionals have limited time to bring in their vehicles for maintenance and
                    service;
                    Increasing real estate costs are forcing many of the vehicle support centers for automotive
                    providers (i.e., dealerships, including body work and diagnostic shops) out of prime urban areas;
                    and
                    New entrants now offer to bring services, such as fueling, damage repair, oil changes, etc.,
                    directly to the car.
                    Collectively, these trends are making it harder for dealers to maintain the service revenue they
                    depend on and DropCar believes that it is well positioned to become the urban mobility partner of
                    note in adapting to these trends.<br><br>

                    “We sell and service some of the most exclusive brands in the world, and we set the highest
                    standards for service and quality,” said Marc Faraj, General Manager at Manhattan Motorcars. “We
                    needed a logistics partner we could trust to deliver those same standards, and DropCar has shown an
                    ability to do just that. Our clients appreciate the convenience, which enables us to make sure their
                    vehicles perform at their peak at all times.”<br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    This press release contains “forward-looking statements” that involve substantial risks and
                    uncertainties for purposes of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform
                    Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press

                    Actual results and performance could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking

                    operational requirements and the impact of competitive products and services and technological
                    changes. The foregoing review of important factors that could cause actual events to differ from
                    expectations should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with statements
                    that are included herein and elsewhere, including the risk factors included in WPCS International

                    automotive logistics and concierge services for both consumers and the automotive industry, jointly
                    announced that today the parties have entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby WPCS will
                    acquire DropCar in an all-stock transaction.<br><br>
                    According to Sebastian Giordano, CEO of WPCS, "Our goal has been to provide an opportunity to
                    enhance stockholder value, and we believe that DropCar is well-positioned to capitalize on the
                    burgeoning auto-tech and next-generation mobility and logistics services industry."
                    Key aspects include:<br><br>
                    DropCar is a leading provider of a cloud and app based logistics and vehicle support platform that
                    reduces the costs, hassles, and inefficiencies of owning or servicing a car or fleet in urban
                    areas;<br><br>

                    DropCar's multi-channel business model is positioned for expansion into new markets and continued
                    partnerships with large OEMs, automotive branded dealerships, shared mobility providers, fleet
                    owners and real estate developers; <br><br>

                    Current stockholders of WPCS are expected to own approximately 15% of the outstanding common stock
                    of WPCS (after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding WPCS stock options) and the
                    stockholders of, and certain advisors to, DropCar are expected to own approximately 85% of the
                    outstanding common stock of WPCS (after giving effect to the exercise of all outstanding DropCar
                    warrants). <br><br>

                    A highly qualified management team with substantial and demonstrated experience in technological
                    innovation and automotive-related logistics will lead the combined company. DropCar's Co-Founder and
                    CEO, Spencer Richardson will assume the role of CEO of the merged entity, while Mr. Giordano will
                    remain as a member of the Board of Directors. In addition to Messrs. Richardson and Giordano, the
                    Board will be comprised of a total of seven directors, including, DropCar's Co-Founder, David
                    Newman, three DropCar designees, and Joshua Silverman who currently serves on WPCS's Board.<br><br>
                    Mr. Richardson is a proven and successful technology innovator who previously built FanBridge into a
                    premier Fan Audience CRM platform with over 600 million fan relationships. Mr. Newman will continue
                    to lead DropCar's business-development, leveraging his 20 years of experience in the legal, real
                    estate and parking garage sectors.<br><br>
                    Mr. Richardson stated that, "Today, our platform takes away the hassle of owning a car in the city
                    for consumers while simultaneously helping OEMs, dealers, and shared mobility providers reduce costs
                    and deepen connections with customers. We believe this merger will enable us to further scale this
                    platform and position us well to become the de-facto standard in a future where auto purchases give
                    way to auto subscriptions."<br><br>
                    Immediately following the completion of the merger, the current stockholders of WPCS are expected to
                    own approximately 15% of the outstanding common stock of WPCS (after giving effect to the dilutive
                    effect of outstanding WPCS stock options) and the stockholders of DropCar, as well as certain
                    advisors to DropCar, are expected to own the remaining approximately 85% of the outstanding common
                    stock of WPCS (after giving effect to the exercise of all outstanding DropCar warrants). The actual
                    allocation of equity will be subject to adjustment based on various factors, including WPCS' "net
                    cash" balance at closing.<br><br>
                    The transaction, which has been approved by the board of directors of both companies, is expected to
                    occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions, including: approval by the
                    stockholders of both WPCS and DropCar; a requirement by DropCar to raise at least $4 million prior
                    to the consummation of the merger; and approval by NASDAQ for the listing of WPCS common stock
                    immediately upon consummation of the merger.
                    Upon closing of the transaction, the merged company will operate under the DropCar name, and the
                    Company's common stock will trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under a ticker symbol to be announced
                    at a later date.<br><br>

                    Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. acted as legal counsel to DropCar. Morse, Zelnick, Rose

          <h1>Our company</h1>
          <h2>Founded and launched in New York City in 2015, DropCar offers its Vehicle Support Platform (VSP), a
            cloud-based platform and mobile app that help consumers and automotive-related companies reduce the cost,
            hassles and inefficiencies of owning a car, or fleet of cars, in urban centers.
            <br>
            DropCar’s technology platform blends the efficiency and scale of cloud computing, machine learning and
            connected cars with the high-touch of highly trained valets to move cars to/from fully staffed, secure
            garages to/from the people (or businesses) who own them.
            <br>
            Consumers use DropCar’s mobile app to ease the cost and stress of owning a car in the city. Dealerships,
            leasing companies, auto manufacturers and shared mobility companies use DropCar’s enterprise platform to
            reduce costs, streamline logistics and deepen relationships with customers.
